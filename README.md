# Fake New Prediction using Passive Aggressive Classifiers ML Algo.

Passive-Aggressive algorithms are generally used for large-scale learning. It is one of the few ‘online-learning algorithms‘. In online machine learning algorithms, the input data comes in sequential order and the machine learning model is updated step-by-step, as opposed to batch learning, where the entire training dataset is used at once

Online-learning algorithm will get a training example, update the classifier, and then throw away the example.
